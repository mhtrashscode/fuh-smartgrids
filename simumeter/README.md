# Smart Meter Simulation
This python project simulates smart meter readings based on random data and connects to a MQTT broker to store simulated readings.

## Setup
- Install python and the pip package manager [Link](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- `git clone <repo URL>` clone the repository
- `cd simumeter` move to the simumeter directory
- `python -m venv .venv` create a virtual environment called *.venv*
- `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` enter the virtual environment (Powershell example, other CLIs may differ)
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` install dependencies into the virutal environment
